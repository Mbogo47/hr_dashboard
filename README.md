# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a data visualization dashboard designed to analyze HR metrics, providing insights into employee demographics, hiring trends, and salary distribution. The dashboard was built using Tableau for visualization.

The dashboard consists of three key sections:
- **Overview:** Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as active employees, new hires, terminations, and department distributions.
- **Demographics:** Analyzes employee gender distribution, education levels, age groups, and the relationship between education and performance.
- **Income Analysis:** Examines salary distribution based on education and gender, age versus job title and salary, and other income-related insights.
